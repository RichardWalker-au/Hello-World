# Hello-World
Following the GitHub tutorial to get started

As per the tutorial I am writing a little about myself
I am new to Git but do have a little programming experience
I am seeking to learn about writing programs with micro-controllers like the Arduino
and in particular using RF remote controls and home automation integration
